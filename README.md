## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning (ML) pipeline, designed and deployed following MLOps best practices. It covers the complete ML lifecycle, from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.  The goal is to demonstrate how to build robust, scalable, and reproducible ML systems in a production-like environment.

This project showcases:

* Automation of the ML pipeline.
* Version control for all components (code, data, models).
* Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) for ML.
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
* Model monitoring and feedback.

## Core Components

The pipeline encompasses the following key stages:

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    * How data is collected from source(s).
    * Data formats and storage locations.
    * Data versioning strategy.
    * Tools/technologies used (e.g., Apache Kafka, AWS S3, Azure Data Lake).
2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering steps.
    * Handling of missing values, outliers, and data scaling.
    * Data validation and quality checks.
    * Tools/technologies used (e.g., Apache Spark, Pandas, Scikit-learn).
3.  **Model Training:**
    * ML model(s) used and their algorithms.
    * Training process, including hyperparameter tuning.
    * Experiment tracking and management.
    * Tools/technologies used (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, MLflow, Kubeflow).
4.  **Model Evaluation:**
    * Metrics used to evaluate model performance (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, AUC).
    * Evaluation strategy (e.g., train/test split, cross-validation).
    * Model validation and testing.
    * Tools/technologies used (e.g., Scikit-learn, custom evaluation scripts).
5.  **Model Deployment:**
    * Deployment strategy (e.g., online serving, batch prediction).
    * Deployment environment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, cloud platform).
    * Model serving infrastructure.
    * Tools/technologies used (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, Flask, FastAPI, AWS SageMaker, Azure ML).
6.  **Model Monitoring:**
    * Monitoring of model performance in production.
    * Detection of data drift and concept drift.
    * Alerting and logging mechanisms.
    * Tools/technologies used (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, custom monitoring scripts).
7.  **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    * Automation of the ML pipeline using CI/CD tools.
    * Version control with Git.
    * Automated testing (unit, integration, and ML-specific tests).
    * Continuous integration and deployment of ML components.
    * Tools/technologies used (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps).

## Architecture

*[Provide a more detailed architecture diagram here, if possible.  This could be a separate image file.]*

The architecture of this project is designed for scalability, maintainability, and reproducibility.  It typically includes:

* **Orchestration:** A workflow orchestration tool to manage the end-to-end pipeline (e.g., Airflow, Kubeflow Pipelines, Prefect).
* **Artifact Store:** A centralized storage for managing data, models, and metadata (e.g., S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage, MLflow).
* **Compute Resources:** Infrastructure for training and serving models (e.g., cloud VMs, Kubernetes clusters).
* **Monitoring System:** Tools for tracking model performance and system health (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
* **CI/CD System:** Automation of pipeline stages (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions).
